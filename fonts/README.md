Place your licensed Impact webfont files in this folder:

- impact.ttf (works directly)
- impact.woff2 (optional)
- impact.woff (optional fallback)

The app is configured to use only this bundled font for generated text.
If the files are missing, queue/export is blocked and a status message is shown.
